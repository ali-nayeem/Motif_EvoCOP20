\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
%In this PhD research, we focus on MSA in the context of phylogeny. Phylogeny estimation from molecular sequences generally usually operates as a two-phase approach. At first, the given sequences are aligned using an MSA method, and then a tree is estimated from the resultant alignment. The quality of inferred trees heavily depends on the quality of the corresponding alignment. There is a large body of literature (e.g.,~\cite{jordan2011effects, chang2014tcs, lake1991order, croan1997evolution, ogden2006multiple, wu2012accounting}) in the biological domain about the relationships between multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees which laid the background for this study.
